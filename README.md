# Smart_Parking_System
In this project, a smart vehicle parking system has been developed using Arduino Uno (ATmega328P). The system automatically manages two servo motors that control the entry and exit barriers by sensing the entry and exit of vehicles with the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor and two IR sensors. While the IR sensors detect the presence of a vehicle, the distance sensor ensures that the barrier opens and closes at the right time for safety purposes. The servo motors open and close the barriers based on the sensor data, providing controlled entry and exit to the parking area. This ensures a cost-effective and automated parking management system.
